## Introduction

The Pinnacle 100 out of box demo demonstrates gathering sensor data over BLE and sending the data to the cloud (AWS) via LTE Cat-M1.
One device that can be used for the demo is the BL654 BME280 sensor. This sensor measures temperature, humidity and pressure.  Another sensor that can be used with the demo is the BT510.  It records temperature and movement.  The BT510 can also be configured to detect a magnet (door open/closed).  
The Pinnacle 100 will scan for the BL654 Sensor and connect to the first one it finds.  The Pinnacle 100 will gather data for the BT510 devices from advertisements without creating a connection.  The demo does not include code for configuring the BT510.  This must be done using the BT510 phone application. 
The demo supports one BL654 Sensor and up to fifteen BT510 sensors.  The demo can be recompiled to remove support for either sensor.
Using the Laird Pinnacle Connect mobile app, the user can provision the Pinnacle 100 to connect to AWS. Once connected to AWS, the Pinnacle will send sensor data (if a sensor is found) to the cloud every 90 seconds. The Pinnacle 100 uses LTE Cat-M1 Power Save Mode(PSM) to save power in this demo.

## Prerequisites

The following are required to use the Pinnacle 100 out of box demo:

- An activated SIM card.  See [here](docs/revx-digikey-faq-v6.pdf) for instructions on activating the SIM card that came with your dev kit.
- Pinnacle 100 DVK programmed with out of box demo firmware. Releases available [here!](https://github.com/LairdCP/Pinnacle_100_oob_demo/releases)
- Laird Pinnacle Connect app installed on a mobile device
  - [Android app](http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lairdconnect.pinnacle.connect)
  - [iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/laird-pinnacle-connect/id1481075861?ls=1)

## Setup

To set up the demo, follow these steps:

1. Install the activated SIM card into the Pinnacle 100 modem SIM slot.
2. Plug the modem into the dev board.
3. Program the Pinnacle 100 Out of Box demo firmware.
4. Launch the mobile app.

## Using the Demo

### Signup and Login

If you do not already have an account, you must create one. An email address shall be used for the username.

### Scan for Devices

Once logged in, the scan screen displays.

![Scan screen](docs/images/scan.png)<br>
_Scan screen_

To scan for devices, follow these steps:

1. Click **Find Pinnacle Devices**. Discovered devices will be displayed.
   > **Note:** The device name contains the last seven digits of the IMEI of the device so that you can easily identify the device to which you wish to connect. The IMEI is printed on the Pinnacle 100 Modem label.

![Scan screen - devices found](docs/images/devices_found.png)  
_Scan screen - devices found_

2. Click on the desired device to connect to it.

### Home Page

The home screen displays status information releated to the OOB demo. From the home page you can commission or decommission the device and navigate to other settings or info pages.

> **Note:** Provisioning is only allowed if the device is in an un-provisioned state.

### Provision

To provision the device click **Provision**.
During provisioning, certificates are generated for the device and then programmed into the device over BLE.

![Provision in process](docs/images/provision_progress.png)  
_Provision in process_

Once sending provisioning data is complete, a prompt displays and you are directed back to the information page.

![Provisioning is complete](docs/images/provision_success.png)  
_Provisioning is complete_

Once the device is successfully connected to Amazon Web Services (AWS), the provisioning data is committed to non-volatile memory in the Pinnacle 100 modem. If the pinnacle 100 is then reset or power-cycled, it automatically re-connects to AWS. If the Pinnacle 100 is reset or power cycled before a successful AWS connection, you must re-provision the device.

## Cloud Data

Once the Pinnacle 100 has been commissioned with the mobile app and it is connected to AWS, the user can log into the web portal to view sensor data.

The web portal is located at: <https://demo.lairdconnect.com>

Log in with the same credentials used to login to the mobile app.

Once logged in go to the devices page to see devices that have been added to the user account.

![Web portal devices page](docs/images/device_portal.png)  
_Web portal devices page_

Each pinnacle 100 that is added is identified by its IMEI.

Click on the device ID to display its data.

![Device data](docs/images/cloud_device_data.png)  
_Device data_

The Pinnacle 100 will report sensor data every 90 seconds. The user can select the check box next to any numeric value to see the value in the graph. The graph only displays live data that is logged while viewing the webpage. If the user leaves the web page and returns, the graph will start over with the most recent data that was received when returning to the page.

## LED behavior

LED1 - LED4 are all on when the modem is booting.

The Blue LED (LED1) will blink once a second when the Pinnacle is searching for a BL654 Sensor. When it finds a sensor and successfully connects to it, the LED will stay on.

The Green LED (LED2) will turn on when connected to AWS. When data is sent to AWS the LED will turn off and then turn back on. When disconnected from AWS the led will remain off.

The Red LED (LED3) will blink when the Pinnacle is searching for a cellular network. It will remain on and not blink when connected to a network. If there is an error with the SIM card or network registration, then the led will remain off.
